## Session 6. Data Management Plans (DMP): DMPs and Best Practices review

### Data In Brief 

Review of Activity from last session: 
- Assignment: 
Create documentation for your project data using the requirements for the[ Elsevier Data in Brief submissions](https://www.elsevier.com/journals/data-in-brief/2352-3409/guide-for-authors) as a guide. Note the [Data in Brief at a Glance](https://www.elsevier.com/__data/promis_misc/Data%20in%20Brief%20Article%20at%20a%20Glance%20illustration.pdf) gives a nice overview of what is needed and the template can be used to develop the document. Put your work in your course GitHub repository and notify instructors when ready for review.

-  Challenges 

  
### Goal: Easy to Understand and Explicit Documentation 
  
The aim of data documentation is straightforward information that provides adequate information to understand the source of the data, the structure of the data and facilitate proper use of the data.  

One way to accomplish this is to ask a colleague or friend to review data documentation. This process can provide an assessment of reusability without the burden of pre-existing knowledge that can fill in omissions.  Asking for a review by someone who is less familiar with the project or field can be very useful in identifying areas that need clarification.

### Have you considered what type of end-user license to include with your data?

- Have you considered what type of end-user license to include with your data? The license towards the data set will use the Creative Commons License.

- My experience in the past with sharing data indicates that licenses mean nothing in countries that do not respect intellectual property, and enforcement is impossible.  I am worried that HWDSB and HWCDSB may speciously assert intellectual property rights.

- The researchers have not considered an end-user license but will discuss closer to the publication of the research.

- General liscence requirements state that after one year papers have to be open acess or available to public. The specificis on liscences are dependent on the journal that the data is being published in. This question may be updated or changed in the future when the DMP is revisited throughout the research project's progression.

- It is not expected to deposit the data in a public repository

## Sustainability

## Internal Management/Archiving –

Succession planning – reporting and who needs to know what

-  What measures do we put in place to make sure data does not get lost or orphaned? 
-  What measures do we put in place to make sure that hand-offs are smooth and effective when project is concluded?
-  How to track changes and keep people aware so that all using the data are using the correct copy (Authoritative files and Version control.)


##  Considerations

### Who has a stake in the data?

https://secretariat.mcmaster.ca/app/uploads/2019/06/Ownership-of-Student-Work.pdf
 -  property of the student and the research supervisor, either of whom has the right to make them available to other
individuals as well. 
-  Both student and supervisor are responsible for insuring that
proper acknowledgement of the contributions of the student, supervisor, and
other members of the research team is made when the data are released in any
form.
-  When the data are acquired through the student's individual effort, and without
the use of University laboratories or funding, then they are usually the property of
the student making that effort. 
- When the student collects data using research instruments including interview schedules and
questionnaires developed wholly or in part by the research supervisor or by some
other person or agency the right to ownership and/or use of
the data may be shared among the parties involved.
-  Given the range of possible alternatives it is not possible to set absolute guidelines in advance covering all
such situations. Consequently, it is recommended that students and supervisors
make clear agreements in advance concerning the ownership and use of data
collected in this fashion.
-  Ownership of data may also be affected by the terms of
a research contract that has supported the work. 

## Student-Supervisor Agreements

https://students.usask.ca/documents/graduate/student-supervisor-agreement.pdf

-  The Student will keep orderly records of all research data produced or developed.
-  Where research data is produced or developed, both the Student and Supervisor(s) will have
access to the data at all times.
-  Both Student and Supervisor(s) understand that the provisions of the University’s Intellectual
Property Policy pertaining to work done while a graduate student, as well as the guidelines
around publication and access to research data, remain in place even after the Student is no
longer attending the University

https://students.usask.ca/graduate/supervisors.php#Whattodiscuss

-  Can my supervisor use my research, written work, and/or take first authorship on articles or presentations using that research or data if, after some fixed amount of time has passed, I have not used the research or data myself?
-  Who has access to my research or data?
-  Am I expected to publish my research or findings, in addition to writing my thesis?
-  Could you tell me about how you manage collaborative projects in terms of such things as who has access to data?
-  If I take a leave, can my supervisor or other students or members of the department use my data for their research or graduate program?

https://ihpme.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/memo-of-understanding-2011.pdf

In addition, the student and supervisor should discuss/define:
-  Ownership and use of data 

https://artsandscience.usask.ca/psychology/documents/student-supervisor-agreement-template.pdf

-  What is the approximate date for completion of lab/field work/collection of data?
-  What is the approximate date for completion of data analysis?

## Licensing 

The data producer or licensor has expended significant resources gathering, assembling and compiling data.  The data is the valuable property of licensor and they should be able to reap some benefit from sharing the data.  One benefit of data sharing is through the acknowledgement and citations included in the work of researchers accessing data. The licensor is able to set out the terms sharing.  This can be done through a Data Use Agreement, a Terms of Use agreement or through licensing.  

### Licenses describe data ownership and Permitted Uses.  

-  Documentation should indicate the licensor's ownership of and the licensee's permitted use of the data.
-  Ideally, researchers should be explicit in how they wish the data to be used and how they wish to be acknowledegesd.

### Creative Commons

https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/#by

### Creative Commons licenses

There are six main Creative Commons licenses you can use when you choose to publish your work under CC terms. The six CC licenses are based on four conditions. The four conditions and the six licenses are described below.

### License Conditions

When using a Creative Commons license, creators choose a set of conditions they wish to apply to their work.

-  Attribution Attribution (by)

  All CC licenses require that others who use your work in any way must give you credit the way you request, but not in a way that suggests you endorse them or their use. If they want to use your work without giving you credit or for endorsement purposes, they must get your permission first.

-  ShareAlike ShareAlike (sa)

  You let others copy, distribute, display, perform, and modify your work, as long as they distribute any modified work on the same terms. If they want to distribute modified works under other terms, tey must get your permission first.

-  NonCommercial NonCommercial (nc)

  You let others copy, distribute, display, perform, and (unless you have chosen NoDerivatives) modify and use your work for any purpose other than commercially unless they get your permission first.

-  NoDerivatives NoDerivatives (nd)

  You let others copy, distribute, display and perform only original copies of your work. If they want to modify your work, they must get your permission first.

-  Attribution (CC BY)image


  This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials.

==================================

-  Attribution ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)image
This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to “copyleft” free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. This is the license used by Wikipedia, and is recommended for materials that would benefit from incorporating content from Wikipedia and similarly licensed projects.

-  Attribution-NoDerivs (CC BY-ND)image  

This license lets others reuse the work for any purpose, including commercially; however, it cannot be shared with others in adapted form, and credit must be provided to you.

-  Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC)image  

  This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don’t have to license their derivative works on the same terms.

-  Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA)image  

  This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms.

-  Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC BY-NC-ND)image  

  This license is the most restrictive of our six main licenses, only allowing others to download your works and share them with others as long as they credit you, but they can’t change them in any way or use them commercially.
  
### Licensing data

This is a complex area. [Wickham](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html#license), for instance, notes that data are not copyrightable in the United States, so if you put data out in the wild you are not giving up much by using a license such as Creative Commons (CC0). 

In practical terms, this means that if you wish to retain control over your data, you should most definitely _not_ put it in the wild, which may be the objective in many situations (e.g., proprietary data, sensitive data, etc.). You can include in lieu of license a notice stating:

```
PROPRIETARY  
  
Do not distribute outside of McMaster Hydrometeorology & Climatology Group
```

This practice, however, is at odds with policy directions by funding organizations to make research data available to the public. What this means is that, if you are the _author_ of the data, that is, you are the primary collector of the data, and you received funding from an organization that encourages or requires data sharing, you might be expected to make the data public at some point, perhaps after a reasonable sequestration period. In that case, the Creative Commons license would be appropriate.

The situation becomes somewhat more complex if you are _not_ the author of the data. In the social sciences it is common to work with secondary data, either from Statistics Canada or various other organizations, some of which may have data policies, but other may not.

To use a case: John is doing research on school closures. His research needs data from different sources:

- Standardized test scores, from [EQAO](http://www.eqao.com/en)

- Socio-economic and demographic data from the [Census Program](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/index-eng.cfm)

- Local data from the [City of Hamilton](http://open.hamilton.ca/)

In addition, he will produce other data, such as accessibility or walkability scores.

EQAO has an agreement that includes, among others, the following conditions:

- The data will be used only for the purposes outlined in the description of the research project.

- Data will not be shared, copied or otherwise made available to additional persons or parties.

- The data shall be destroyed one year after the research project is completed.

EQAO is a crown agency, meaning a state-owned enterprise, and the data are semi-public in the sense that EQAO maintains a [data portal](http://www.eqao.com/en/research#Access) and seems to grant all reasonable requests, as long as any information that could be used to identify individuals is not requested. It seems plausible that anonymized records could be put in the public domain, but maintaining control of the data is the default for most organizations.

Statistics Canada, on the other hand, operates under an [Open License](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/reference/licence) that grants users of information that Statistics Canada has made public, fairly unrestricted rights in its use:

>>Subject to this licence, Statistics Canada grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive licence to:
>>
>> - use, reproduce, publish, freely distribute, or sell the Information;  
>> - use, reproduce, publish, freely distribute, or sell Value-added Products; and,  
>> - sublicence any or all such rights, under terms consistent with this licence.  
>>  
>> In doing any of the above, you shall:
>>  
>> - reproduce the Information accurately;  
>> - not use the Information in a way that suggests that Statistics Canada endorses you or your use of the Information;  
>> - not misrepresent the Information or its source;  
>> - use the Information in a manner that does not breach or infringe any applicable laws;  
>> - not merge or link the Information with any other databases for the purpose of attempting to identify an individual person, business or organization;  
>> - not present the Information in such a manner that gives the appearance that you may have received, or had access to, information held by Statistics Canada about any identifiable individual person, business or organization; and  
>> - not disassemble, decompile or in any way attempt to reverse engineer any software provided as part of the Information.

Notice that although Statistics Canada may modify this license at any time, use of publicly available data products is governed by the license in force _at the date and time that the information was accessed_. Therefore, it is advisable to document accession date and time with any datasets obtained from Statistics Canada.

Which datasets are covered by this license? Pretty much all publicly available data products:

- data files
- databases
- public use microdata files
- publications
- tables
- graphs
- maps
- reports
- texts

The license also specifies the following:

>> (a) You shall include and maintain the following notice on all licensed rights of the Information:
>>
>> Source: Statistics Canada, name of product, reference date. Reproduced and distributed on an "as is" basis with the permission of Statistics Canada.
>> 
>> (b) Where any Information is contained within a Value-added Product, you shall include on such Value-added Product the following notice:
>>
>> Adapted from Statistics Canada, name of product, reference date. This does not constitute an endorsement by Statistics Canada of this product.

Other jurisdictions have also adopted variations of open licenses for their data portals, including the [City of Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-licence/) and the [City of Hamilton](https://www.hamilton.ca/city-initiatives/strategies-actions/open-data-licence-terms-and-conditions).

If you are using data that you did not primarily collect, it is a good idea to understand what your rights as a user are, especially if you wish to ensure that research is reproducible.

## Long Term Preservation and Storage

### Selecting a Data Repository
https://www.bu.edu/data/share/selecting-a-data-repository/

### Things to Consider
Many data repositories exist today. Some will be a better fit for your needs more than others. Here are some tips on selecting a data repository for your research:

### Reputation
Is the repository a reputable source? Check to see if it is endorsed by a funding agency, scholarly journal, professional society, library, or if it is listed in the Registry of Research Data Repositories. Publishing your data, like publishing an article, is best done with a reputable partner that is backed by an institution or your research community.

### Sustainability
Having you data deposited in a repository that is unsustainable defeats the point of depositing it. This is why it is important to make sure your repository has the support of an institution, community, or funder. You’ll want to ensure the depository you select will be providing access to your data for well over 5 years. Many repositories will also have preservation plans and contingency plans on the outside chance funding is ceased. Lastly, don’t be afraid to ask about these plans.

### Visibility
One of the primary reasons to deposit your data in a repository is to obtain a unique identifier that others can use to cite your data. This service will increase the visibility of your data within the scholarly literature and allows researchers to find it later on. Ensure your data repository offers a DOI (digital object identifier), handle, or another unique indentifer.

Another way to think about visibility is to ask if researchers in your field use a repository. Some disciplines have an agreed upon repository that everyone uses and knows about. Ensure that you’re putting your data where the appropriate researchers are likely to find it (and hopefully use it).

### Usability
The usability of a data repository is also important in ensuring that others will be able to access your data. Unfortunately, not all repositories have the funding to create great web interfaces with simple, intuitive interactions. However, if your peers are unable to find and download your data it will limit the effectiveness of sharing your data. A usable data repository should allow for users to easily upload, download, and cite data sets.

### Features
Some data repositories have really great features like integrations with Open Science Framework, GitHub, or other commercial storage solutions. While these feature may not be the keystones to providing long-term access to your data, they can help you share your data more frequently and effectively. Additionally, an author dashboard (a place you can view statistics, like downloads, on your data sets) or easy-to-understand licensing, like Creative Commons, can make your life a little easier. Lastly, you’ll want to review the upload and storage limits. Some repositories offer limited free storage before a fee is charged. Be sure to look over each data repository’s features and compare them with comparable services.

### Formats
Most data repositories are able to handle most formats; however, this doesn’t always guarantee that they’ll be able to work with your data. Be sure to take a look at the repositories documentation to ensure they can store the data you’ve generated. In addition, see if the repository can generate previews or provide other user interactions with your data. While these features are not essential from a preservation perspective, they do help users understand and access your data.

### Rights
Know your rights! Take time out to read the terms of use and to understand what permissions you’re giving the data repository. For instance, does your data repository use common licensing agreements (again, like Creative Commons) that will help others understand what they can and cannot do with your data?


### Activity

1. Review Data Management Plan
    - Revise your Data Management Best Practice (as needed) to be easy to follow instructions to guide your work
    - Review the DMP Questionnaire of a colleague to gain additional feedback 
        -  Share plan with your partner so that they can read your DMP and provide feedback
        -  Read and provide feedback to your partner on the DMP that they have shared with you.
    - Export and upload your complete DMP to GitHub. 
2. For Next Week:
    -  Bring a sample dataset to class next week to be used in the R exercise
