## DMPs and Best Practices review

### DMPs
-  Challenges
-  Peer Review

### Best Practices

-  Simple document that lays out step by step how you will implement one aspect of the DMP
-  For instance, define specifically what your naming conventions will be or your file structure.  
-  Actionable reference document to support your work.

###  Take a few minutes to read another DMP and provide feedback

## Forensic Issues and Archiving

### From the DMP submissions

### How will responsibilities for managing data activities be handled if substantive
### changes happen in the personnel overseeing the project's data, including a
### change of Principal Investigator?

- It is unlikely that there will be a change in Principal Investigator. In the event that the thesis supervisor begins working at a different institution, he will retain the responsibility for overseeing the management of the data. The thesis supervisor will continue to own the private repository where the data is stored and the student investigator will keep access

- Within the Data Plan Management, it is considered that professor Juan Gomez will be responsible for the data in case the current responsible leaves the project.

- Once I have completed my project and have completed my master's program, the student that will replace me, along with my supervisor or any other collaborators will be given the data and informed on how the data has been stored so that they may continue to preserve the data until it becomes no longer necessary. This question may be updated or changed in the future when the DMP is revisited throughout the research project's progression. 

- data activities will cease and data will remain on Github

- The data will be managed by the supervisor and or the future student that continues the project afterwards. They will be responsible for maintaining the storage mediums and ensuring they are in working order.

- Back up copies of all data are kept on the institute server. Given major changes, the most recently deposited data and associated information would be available. The memoing associated with the coding process would guide an individual if they were to over take the process mid way.

### Have you considered what type of end-user license to include with your data?

- Have you considered what type of end-user license to include with your data? The license towards the data set will use the Creative Commons License.

- My experience in the past with sharing data indicates that licenses mean nothing in countries that do not respect intellectual property, and enforcement is impossible.  I am worried that HWDSB and HWCDSB may speciously assert intellectual property rights.

- The researchers have not considered an end-user license but will discuss closer to the publication of the research.

- General liscence requirements state that after one year papers have to be open acess or available to public. The specificis on liscences are dependent on the journal that the data is being published in. This question may be updated or changed in the future when the DMP is revisited throughout the research project's progression.

- It is not expected to deposit the data in a public repository

## What happens when life happens...

### What if one of the people working on your data was suddenly gone (death, illness, another opportunity, lottery winner!)
## Internal Management/Archiving –

Succession planning – reporting and who needs to know what

-  What measures do we put in place to make sure data does not get lost or orphaned? 
-  What measures do we put in place to make sure that hand-offs are smooth and effective when project is concluded?
-  How to track changes and keep people aware so that all using the data are using the correct copy (Authoritative files and Version control.)


##  Considerations

### Who has a stake in the data?

https://secretariat.mcmaster.ca/app/uploads/2019/06/Ownership-of-Student-Work.pdf
 -  property of the student and the research supervisor, either of whom has the right to make them available to other
individuals as well. 
-  Both student and supervisor are responsible for insuring that
proper acknowledgement of the contributions of the student, supervisor, and
other members of the research team is made when the data are released in any
form.
-  When the data are acquired through the student's individual effort, and without
the use of University laboratories or funding, then they are usually the property of
the student making that effort. 
- When the student collects data using research instruments including interview schedules and
questionnaires developed wholly or in part by the research supervisor or by some
other person or agency the right to ownership and/or use of
the data may be shared among the parties involved.
-  Given the range of possible alternatives it is not possible to set absolute guidelines in advance covering all
such situations. Consequently, it is recommended that students and supervisors
make clear agreements in advance concerning the ownership and use of data
collected in this fashion.
-  Ownership of data may also be affected by the terms of
a research contract that has supported the work. 

## Student-Supervisor Agreements

https://students.usask.ca/documents/graduate/student-supervisor-agreement.pdf

-  The Student will keep orderly records of all research data produced or developed.
-  Where research data is produced or developed, both the Student and Supervisor(s) will have
access to the data at all times.
-  Both Student and Supervisor(s) understand that the provisions of the University’s Intellectual
Property Policy pertaining to work done while a graduate student, as well as the guidelines
around publication and access to research data, remain in place even after the Student is no
longer attending the University

https://students.usask.ca/graduate/supervisors.php#Whattodiscuss

-  Can my supervisor use my research, written work, and/or take first authorship on articles or presentations using that research or data if, after some fixed amount of time has passed, I have not used the research or data myself?
-  Who has access to my research or data?
-  Am I expected to publish my research or findings, in addition to writing my thesis?
-  Could you tell me about how you manage collaborative projects in terms of such things as who has access to data?
-  If I take a leave, can my supervisor or other students or members of the department use my data for their research or graduate program?

https://ihpme.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/memo-of-understanding-2011.pdf

In addition, the student and supervisor should discuss/define:
-  Ownership and use of data 

https://artsandscience.usask.ca/psychology/documents/student-supervisor-agreement-template.pdf

-  What is the approximate date for completion of lab/field work/collection of data?
-  What is the approximate date for completion of data analysis?


## Have you considered what type of end-user license to include with your data? 

-  My experience in the past with sharing data indicates that licenses mean nothing in countries that do not respect intellectual property, and enforcement is impossible. This document was generated by DMP Assistant (https://assistant.portagenetwork.ca) 3 of 5 Intellectual property rights have not been considered at this stage. I am worried that HWDSB and HWCDSB may speciously assert intellectual property rights.

-  The researchers have not considered an end-user license but will discuss closer to the publication of the research.

-  General license requirements state that after one year papers have to be open access or available to public. The specifics on licenses are dependent on the journal that the data is being published in. This question may be updated or changed in the future when the DMP is revisited throughout the research project's progression.

-  It is not expected to deposit the data in a public repository


-  The license towards the data set will use the Creative Commons License.

### Licensing Considerations

- The licensor has expended significant resources gathering, assembling and compiling the data, and that the data is the valuable property of licensor

Data ownership and use
-  licensor's ownership of and the licensee's permitted use of the data.
-  specific acknowledgment from the licensee of the source

## Creative Commons

https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/#by

### Creative Commons licenses
There are six main Creative Commons licenses you can use when you choose to publish your work under CC terms. The six CC licenses are based on four conditions. The four conditions and the six licenses are described below.

### License Conditions
When using a Creative Commons license, creators choose a set of conditions they wish to apply to their work.

-  Attribution Attribution (by)

All CC licenses require that others who use your work in any way must give you credit the way you request, but not in a way that suggests you endorse them or their use. If they want to use your work without giving you credit or for endorsement purposes, they must get your permission first.

-  ShareAlike ShareAlike (sa)

You let others copy, distribute, display, perform, and modify your work, as long as they distribute any modified work on the same terms. If they want to distribute modified works under other terms, tey must get your permission first.

-  NonCommercial NonCommercial (nc)

You let others copy, distribute, display, perform, and (unless you have chosen NoDerivatives) modify and use your work for any purpose other than commercially unless they get your permission first.

-  NoDerivatives NoDerivatives (nd)

You let others copy, distribute, display and perform only original copies of your work. If they want to modify your work, they must get your permission first.

-  Attribution (CC BY)image
This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials.
==================================

-  Attribution ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)image
This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to “copyleft” free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. This is the license used by Wikipedia, and is recommended for materials that would benefit from incorporating content from Wikipedia and similarly licensed projects.


-  Attribution-NoDerivs (CC BY-ND)image
This license lets others reuse the work for any purpose, including commercially; however, it cannot be shared with others in adapted form, and credit must be provided to you.

-  Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC)image
This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don’t have to license their derivative works on the same terms.

-  Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA)image
This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms.

-  Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC BY-NC-ND)image
This license is the most restrictive of our six main licenses, only allowing others to download your works and share them with others as long as they credit you, but they can’t change them in any way or use them commercially.

## Long Term Preservation and Storage

### Selecting a Data Repository
https://www.bu.edu/data/share/selecting-a-data-repository/

### Things to Consider
Many data repositories exist today. Some will be a better fit for your needs more than others. Here are some tips on selecting a data repository for your research:

### Reputation
Is the repository a reputable source? Check to see if it is endorsed by a funding agency, scholarly journal, professional society, library, or if it is listed in the Registry of Research Data Repositories. Publishing your data, like publishing an article, is best done with a reputable partner that is backed by an institution or your research community.

### Sustainability
Having you data deposited in a repository that is unsustainable defeats the point of depositing it. This is why it is important to make sure your repository has the support of an institution, community, or funder. You’ll want to ensure the depository you select will be providing access to your data for well over 5 years. Many repositories will also have preservation plans and contingency plans on the outside chance funding is ceased. Lastly, don’t be afraid to ask about these plans.

### Visibility
One of the primary reasons to deposit your data in a repository is to obtain a unique identifier that others can use to cite your data. This service will increase the visibility of your data within the scholarly literature and allows researchers to find it later on. Ensure your data repository offers a DOI (digital object identifier), handle, or another unique indentifer.

Another way to think about visibility is to ask if researchers in your field use a repository. Some disciplines have an agreed upon repository that everyone uses and knows about. Ensure that you’re putting your data where the appropriate researchers are likely to find it (and hopefully use it).

### Usability
The usability of a data repository is also important in ensuring that others will be able to access your data. Unfortunately, not all repositories have the funding to create great web interfaces with simple, intuitive interactions. However, if your peers are unable to find and download your data it will limit the effectiveness of sharing your data. A usable data repository should allow for users to easily upload, download, and cite data sets.

### Features
Some data repositories have really great features like integrations with Open Science Framework, GitHub, or other commercial storage solutions. While these feature may not be the keystones to providing long-term access to your data, they can help you share your data more frequently and effectively. Additionally, an author dashboard (a place you can view statistics, like downloads, on your data sets) or easy-to-understand licensing, like Creative Commons, can make your life a little easier. Lastly, you’ll want to review the upload and storage limits. Some repositories offer limited free storage before a fee is charged. Be sure to look over each data repository’s features and compare them with comparable services.

### Formats
Most data repositories are able to handle most formats; however, this doesn’t always guarantee that they’ll be able to work with your data. Be sure to take a look at the repositories documentation to ensure they can store the data you’ve generated. In addition, see if the repository can generate previews or provide other user interactions with your data. While these features are not essential from a preservation perspective, they do help users understand and access your data.

### Rights
Know your rights! Take time out to read the terms of use and to understand what permissions you’re giving the data repository. For instance, does your data repository use common licensing agreements (again, like Creative Commons) that will help others understand what they can and cannot do with your data?


### Activity

1. Review Data Management Plan
    - Revise your Data Management Best Practice (as needed) to be easy to follow instructions to guide your work
    - Review the DMP Questionnaire of a colleague to gain additional feedback
    - Upload your complete DMP to GitHub.  Please feel free to write this as a narrative/methods segment for a research report/proposal
