### The Research Data Lifecycle Revisited

### Planning at the start of the project will have positive impacts which cascade through the project and help you achieve a better end product with less stress.  

- Creating a set of policies/procedures will benefit the current project and provide a foundation for future projects as well.  This is another way that we can "reuse" in our research.

### DMP Assistant: Data Collection

- What types of data will you collect, create, link to, acquire and/or record?
- What file formats will your data be collected in? Will these formats allow for data re-use, sharing and long-term access to the data?
- What conventions and procedures will you use to structure, name and version-control your files to help you and others better understand how your data are organized?

Resources:  File format, naming, organization

#### Reflections and Best Practices

    - File formats
    - Document structure

### DMP Assistant: Documentation and Metadata

- What documentation will be needed for the data to be read and interpreted correctly in the future?
- How will you make sure that documentation is created or captured consistently throughout your project?
- If you are using a metadata standard and/or tools to document and describe your data, please list here.

#### Reflections and Best Practices

    - Process Documentation
    - Standardization
    - Readme files
    - Metadata standards

### DMP Assistant: Storage and Backup

- What are the anticipated storage requirements for your project, in terms of storage space (in megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, etc.) and the length of time you will be storing it?
- How and where will your data be stored and backed up during your research project?
- How will the research team and other collaborators access, modify, and contribute data throughout the project?

#### Reflections and Best Practices

    - File Organization
    - Process Documentation - identfiy media and frequency of backups
    - Standardization

### DMP Assistant: Preservation

- Where will you deposit your data for long-term preservation and access at the end of your research project?
- Indicate how you will ensure your data is preservation ready. Consider preservation-friendly file formats, ensuring file integrity, anonymization and de-identification, inclusion of supporting documentation

#### Reflections and Best Practices

    - Process Documentation
    - Identify best formats for preservation

### DMP Assistant: Sharing and Reuse

- What data will you be sharing and in what form? (e.g. raw, processed, analyzed, final).
- Have you considered what type of end-user license to include with your data?
- What steps will be taken to help the research community know that your data exists?

#### Reflections and Best Practices

    - Process Documentation
    - Document how data will be provided to your supervisor and/or collaborators/coworkers

### DMP Assistant: Responsibilities and Resources

- Identify who will be responsible for managing this project's data during and after the project and the major data management tasks for which they will be responsible.
- How will responsibilities for managing data activities be handled if substantive changes happen in the personnel overseeing the project's data, including a change of Principal Investigator?
- What resources will you require to implement your data management plan? What do you estimate the overall cost for data management to be?

#### Reflections and Best Practices

    - Process Documentation - Day to day handling of data
    - Standardization

### DMP Assistant: Ethics and Legal Compliance

- If your research project includes sensitive data, how will you ensure that it is securely managed and accessible only to approved members of the project?
- If applicable, what strategies will you undertake to address secondary uses of sensitive data?
- How will you manage legal, ethical, and intellectual property issues?

#### Reflections and Best Practices

    - Best practices/standards (Store approved uses and storage requirements with data)

### Activity

1. Reflect on the data in your project 
    - Define a Best Practice Document to guide your work
    - Create a brief data management plan for your project
